options:
  alias:
    type: string
    default: "default"
    description: |
      An alias given to the storage pool. This alias will be used to
      derive the volume-group name and the backend name, and the idea
      is to differentiate volume groups and backend names if you deploy
      multiple instances of the charm on the same host.
      .
      If you are only deploying one instance, this name does not matter
      and "default" is probably ok. But if you are deploying multiple
      instances then change the name on each instance to a more
      meaningful name, like "pool1", "pool2", etc. or "fast", "slow" in
      case you want to name them after the kind of storage you have.
  allocation-type:
    type: string
    default: 'default'
    description: |
      Select between thin or thick models when allocating logical volumes
      in volume group. Options are 'default' for thick, 'thin' for thin
      or 'auto' for thin if supported otherwise thick.
  block-device:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The block devices on which to create an LVM volume group. This is
      a mandatory option and leaving it blank will give you and error.
      .
      This can be a space-separated list of block devices to attempt
      to use in the cinder lvm volume group. Each block device detected
      will be added to the available physical volumes in the volume group.
      .
      Formatting as a physical volume will fail if the device is already
      formatted and may potentially have data, unless 'overwrite' is true.
      .
      May be set to the path and size of a local file
      (/path/to/file|$sizeG), which will be created and used as a
      loopback device (for testing only). $sizeG defaults to 5G.
  overwrite:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If true, charm will attempt to overwrite block devices containing
      previous filesystems or LVM, assuming it is not in use.
  erase-size:
    type: string
    default: '0'
    description: |
      Normally volumes are zeroed completelly before being released after
      deletion, thus making it slow. Set to a small number to zero only
      that amount of MB in the beginning of the volume (ex. 50). Values
      are in MB and 0 (the default) means all (the whole volume).
  unique-backend:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      Normally all backends which this charm configures are going to
      register themselves with Cinder using the same backend name (the
      name of the volume group), therefore allowing Cinder to use them
      as a cluster and schedule volume creation to any of the nodes
      that pass cinder filter selection. Set this to True to make each
      host register with a unique name (volume-group name + hostname)
      so that each host can be individually addressable in cinder
      backend list.
  remove-missing:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, if logical volumes are not allocated on them.
  remove-missing-force:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      If True, charm will attempt to remove missing physical volumes from
      volume group, even when logical volumes are allocated on them. This
      option overrides 'remove-missing' when set.
  ephemeral-unmount:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Cloud instances provide ephemeral storage which is normally mounted
      on /mnt.
      .
      Providing this option will force an unmount of the ephemeral device
      so that it can be used as a Cinder storage device. This is useful for
      testing purposes (cloud deployment is not a typical use case).
      .
      You need to pass the mount point to be unmounted, if blank (or
      invalid) it will be ignored.
  config-flags:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Comma-separated list of key=value config flags. These values will be
      added to standard options when injecting config into cinder.conf.
  volume-group:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Volume group name to use within LVM. If empty, the volume group name
      will be constructed by concatenating the 'alias' config option to the
      prefix 'cinder-volumes-'.
  backend-name:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      The backend name to provide to the cinder charm. If empty, the backend name
      will be constructed from the 'alias' parameter, and the unit's hostname, if
      the charm has the config option 'unique-backend' set to True.
